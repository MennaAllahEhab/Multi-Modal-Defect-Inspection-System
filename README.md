## 🌟 Key Features

* **Multi-Modal Early Fusion:** Combines spatial image features with physical numerical sensor readings.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrated **Grad-CAM** heatmaps to visualize exact regions driving defect classifications.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with **Streamlit** allowing real-time image uploads and dynamic sensor adjustments.
* **Model Optimization:** Trained in PyTorch and exported to **ONNX Runtime** for high-efficiency inference.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Vision Feature Extractor:** CNN Backbone processing surface images ($224 \times 224$).
2. **Sensor Processing Stream:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) normalizing numerical telemetry data.
3. **Early Fusion Layer:** Concatenates visual vector features with numerical sensor embeddings before final classification logits.
